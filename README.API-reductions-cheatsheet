This README file is intended to describe the utility created to automate the
renaming of APIs in UVM which will hide them from the end users.  This script
is called make_uvm_ieee.pl and is located in the ./admin/bin directory.  

This specific package of UVM is not an official release.  In fact, in the
distrib directory you will find both a ./src/ directory and a ./src_orig.  The
src_orig is the original BCL of UVM and is here for reference.  The src
directory contains the modified BCL where all the APIs are hidden.

With the current changeset there are 34 failing tests.  My gold test run only
had 27 failures. 

Total of 475 tests ........................... FAILED 34 of 475 tests (0 skipped)

I highly recommend you run all the tests prior to making any changes yourself
so that you have a baseline/gold run to compare it against.  

If you want to test out/hide addition APIs, here are the steps to run to automate the
change.  

1. Open the file -> emacs ./admin/bin/make_uvm_ieee.pl &

2. Look for the array called -> @non_user_apis and add the name of the
string/method or string/API that you want hidden.  

3. cd into the ./distrib/src_orig directory

4. run the script -> ../../admin/bin/make_uvm_ieee.pl

What just happened?  All the UVM source files from your current directory
"src_orig" were read in, parsed, and anywhere the strings in the array
@non_user_apis was encountered a suffix of '_ieee' was added to the string and
then all the collateral were written out to the ../src directory.  

You should now be able to run your tests just like you normally do.
