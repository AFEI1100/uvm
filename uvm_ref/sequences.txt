Title: Sequence Classes

Sequences encapsulate user-defined procedures that generate multiple
<ovm_sequence_item>-based transactions. Such sequences can be reused,
extended, randomized, and combined sequentially and hierarchically
in interesting ways to produce realistic stimulus to your DUT.

With ~ovm_sequence~ objects, users can encapsulate DUT initializaton
code, bus-based stress tests, network protocol stacks-- anything
procedural-- then have them all execute in specific or random order
to more quickly reach corner cases and coverage goals. 

The OVM sequence item and sequence class hierarchy is shown below.

(see ovm_ref_sequence.gif)

- <ovm_sequence_item> - The ~ovm_sequence_item~ is the base class
  for user-defined transactions that leverage the stimulus generation
  and control capabilities of the sequence-sequencer mechanism.

- <ovm_sequence #(REQ,RSP)> - The ~ovm_sequence~ extends ~ovm_sequence_item~ to
  add the ability to generate streams of ~ovm_sequence_items~, either
  directly or by recursively execting other ~ovm_sequences~.
