Title: Synchronization Classes

(see ovm_ref_sync.gif)

The OVM provides event and barrier synchronization classes
for managing concurrent processes. 

- <ovm_event> - OVM's event class augments the SystemVerilog
event datatype with such services as setting callbacks and data delivery.

- <ovm_barrier> - A barrier is used to prevent a pre-configured number of
processes from continuing until all have reached a certain point in simulation. 

- <ovm_event_pool> and <ovm_barrier_pool> -
The event and barrier pool classes are used to store collections of events and
barriers, all indexed by string name.  Each pool class contains a static,
"global" pool instance for sharing across all processes.
