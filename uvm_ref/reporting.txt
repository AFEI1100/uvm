Group: Reporting Classes

The reporting classes provide a facility for issuing reports with consistent
formatting. Users can configure what actions to take and what files to send
output to based on report severity, ID, or both severity and ID. Users can
also filter messages based on their verbosity settings.

The primary interface to the OVM reporting facility is the <ovm_report_object>
from which all <ovm_components> extend. The ovm_report_object delegates most
tasks to its internal <ovm_report_handler>. If the report handler determines
the report is not filtered based the configured verbosity setting, it sends
the report to the central <ovm_report_server> for formatting and processing.
