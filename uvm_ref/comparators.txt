Group: Comparators

A common function of testbenches is to compare streams of transactions for
equivalence. For example, a testbench may compare a stream of transactions from
a DUT with expected results.

The OVM library provides a base class called ~ovm_in_order_comparator~ and two
derived classes: ~ovm_in_order_built_in_comparator~ for comparing
streams of built-in types and ~ovm_in_order_class_comparator~ for comparing
streams of class objects.

The ~ovm_algorithmic_comparator~ also compares two streams of transactions,
but the transaction streams might be of different type objects. Thus, this
comparator will employ a user-defined transformation function to
convert one type to another before performing a comparison.
